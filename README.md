**CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT**



This provides SQLite3 database access API on Swift.





Getting Started
---------------
Embed the project as a subproject of your project, and link iOS dynamic
framewor target. If you need to target iOS 7-, then you have to copy the
source files manually into your project. Because Swift is not currently
supporting static library target.







How to Use
----------

(placeholder)

















Objective-C
-----------
Good old Objective-C version library still exists in `ObjectiveC` folder.
Anyway, it's completely separated version, and nothing related to Swift 
version. Swift version is pure Swift based, and interfaces to SQLite3 C 
API directly.
