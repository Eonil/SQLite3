///	`Core` layer manages these stuffs in proper Swift semantics.
///	-	type conversion into Swift semantics. 
///	-	error detection and handling (currently, all errors just crashes)
///	-	input/output validation
///	No extra abstractions or lifecycle management. You still need
///	to manage lifecycle yourself manually in upper layer.
///	Most errors will just crash the execution except a very few 
///	exceptions. Some preflight test code will be provided.
