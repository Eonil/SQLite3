2012/12/21, Eonil; Should I make `EESQLiteStatement` to retain `EESQLiteDatabase` object?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, statement object doesn't retain database object, but SQLite3 actually
does it. It forces the DB object to be alive until all the statement objects are dead
by error.

I expect I will update statement object to retain database object.
